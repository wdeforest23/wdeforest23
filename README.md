- I'm a recent MS in Applied Data Science Grad (and student athlete ⚾) from the **University of Chicago**
- I graduated in 2023 from **Claremont McKenna College** where I majored in Econ, minored in Data Science and was a 2x baseball captain
- I've worked in an array of fields including commercial real estate, sports analytics, and tech and have found that I enjoy myself most when building something new and useful
- Home is **Seattle, WA**
